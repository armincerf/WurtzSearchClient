# WurtzSearch Client

This is the frontend client of https://alexthings.co.uk/wurtzsearch

## Installation


```bash
git clone https://github.com/armincerf/WurtzSearchClient.git
cd WurtzSearchClient
npm install
```

Run the build script a first time, in order to avoid 404 errors about missing `bundle.css` in the browser:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Development

To run the app locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000), when you make changes to the .svelte files the browser will automatically reload the page.
If you change the index.html you'll need to reload manually.

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```
